# 🛍 E-Shop

This project is a modern internet shop called **E-Shop**, built with pure JavaScript. It allows users to browse products, sign up or log in, view product details, add items to the cart, and place orders. The system includes basic user authentication, product management, and a dynamic shopping experience — all created without React or any modern framework.
